## SplurtyMcBean (aka. "Don't let 'em rain on your parade")

A quotes generator application providing humorous insight, perspective and advice when encountering challenging personalities in daily life.  Tutorial-based creation but heavily customized with significant structure (HTML) and style (CSS) modifications. Self-directed execution to establish "pagination" functionality of data provided, as well.

Technologies used and explored:
* Ruby and Rails
* PostgreSQL
* Bootstrap
* SCSS
* Git and GitHub (_well "Duh", right?_)
* Heroku for the production platform
* MVC design pattern
* RESTful routing sans scaffolding

Check it out on Heroku [here](https://splurtymcbean.herokuapp.com)! Feel free to contribute a quote, but please be topically relevant with your submissions.
