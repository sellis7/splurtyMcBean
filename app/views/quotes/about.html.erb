	<h1>About Splurty</h1>

	<p>Splurty, or "No Man Is an Island", was designed as a project by way of
		tutorials through The FirehoseProject, and customized to get one through a
		typical day of dealing with challenging personalities. We've all met them,
		I'm sure. Just know, you are not fighting this daily battle alone. Oh no,
		my friend… we're all in this together.</p>
	<p>After an extensive career in the graphic print industry – and most
		recently experiencing an on-slaught of "characters" of which I never
		knew could exist, professionally – I determined that life is just too short,
		and happiness is far too important. Continuing along in that profession as
		a safe, straight and narrow path was just not a viable option anymore.
		It was time to set out and explore new professional horizons.
	</p>
	<p>And here we are.

	<h4 class="alice">"But I don’t want to go among mad people,” Alice remarked. <br />
		“Oh, you can’t help that,” said the Cat: “We’re all mad here. <br />
		I’m mad. You’re mad.” <br />
		“How do you know I’m mad?” said Alice. <br />
		“You must be,” said the Cat, “or you wouldn’t have come here.”</h4>

	<p>So, I hope this application gives you a smile and a smirk as you think upon that
		"lovely" person who you may have had a run-in with earlier. Possibly, an
		inspirational and rather witty sentiment helped you to keep a level head
		and maintain more decorum than they probably could or did. Maybe you have a
		brilliant quote that best expresses your take on what it means to survive a
		daily interaction with "other people's children". If so, please feel free to share
		… it's a big world, and we could all use a little insight to get along.
